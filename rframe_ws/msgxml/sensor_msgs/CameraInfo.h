        This message defines meta information for a camera. It should be in a  camera namespace on topic "camera_info" and accompanied by up to five  image topics named:     image_raw - raw data from the camera driver, possibly Bayer encoded    image            - monochrome, distorted    image_color      - color, distorted    image_rect       - monochrome, rectified    image_rect_color - color, rectified   The image_pipeline contains packages (image_proc, stereo_image_proc)  for producing the four processed image topics from image_raw and  camera_info. The meaning of the camera parameters are described in  detail at http://www.ros.org/wiki/image_pipeline/CameraInfo.   The image_geometry package provides a user-friendly interface to  common operations using this meta information. If you want to, e.g.,  project a 3d point into image coordinates, we strongly recommend  using image_geometry.   If the camera is uncalibrated, the matrices D, K, R, P should be left  zeroed out. In particular, clients may assume that K[0] == 0.0  indicates an uncalibrated camera.

That is, the left 3x3 portion   is the normal camera intrinsic matrix for the rectified image.  It projects 3D points in the camera coordinate frame to 2D pixel   coordinates using the focal lengths (fx', fy') and principal point   (cx', cy') - these may differ from the values in K.  For monocular cameras, Tx = Ty = 0. Normally, monocular cameras will   also have R = the identity and P[1:3,1:3] = K.  For a stereo pair, the fourth column [Tx Ty 0]' is related to the   position of the optical center of the second camera in the first   camera's frame. We assume Tz = 0 so both cameras are in the same   stereo image plane. The first camera always has Tx = Ty = 0. For   the right (second) camera of a horizontal stereo pair, Ty = 0 and   Tx = -fx' * B, where B is the baseline between the cameras.  Given a 3D point [X Y Z]', the projection (x, y) of the point onto   the rectified image is given by:   [u v w]' = P * [X Y Z 1]'          x = u / w          y = v / w   This holds for both images of a stereo pair. */
